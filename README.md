# ReAction-iP
Proof of concept/MVP for a game I'm considering.
Like most of my repositories, it's just here so I can run CI easier.
All my test devices are in rigs, and my daily driver is paired to Xcode on a machine three feet away, and as this project requires accelorometer testing, I'll need to deploy to a device I can hold.
Now, I /do/ have network sharing, airdrop, flash drives, scp, there's a million and one way I could get the files over to the other machine, but this just seems the most elegant, does it not?
...I think we all owe Linus a drink of whatever it is that best soothes his soul.
